## Overview

The Windows Command Line MCP Server provides a robust, secure bridge between AI models and Windows system operations. It allows controlled execution of commands, project creation, and system information retrieval while maintaining strict security protocols.

## Key Features

### ðŸ”’ Enhanced Security
- Comprehensive command allowlist
- Strict input validation
- Prevention of destructive system operations
- Configurable security levels

### ðŸ›  Development Tools Support
- Project creation for React, Node.js, and Python
- Safe development environment interactions
- Expanded command support for development workflows

### ðŸ–¥ System Interaction Capabilities
- Execute Windows CLI commands
- Run PowerShell scripts
- Retrieve system and network information
- Manage processes and services

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 16 or later
- npm or yarn
- Windows operating system

### Setup
```bash
git clone https://github.com/alxspiker/Windows-Command-Line-MCP-Server.git
cd Windows-Command-Line-MCP-Server
npm install
npm run build
```

## Usage

### Command Line Options
- Default mode: Uses predefined safe commands
- `--allow-all`: Run in extended mode (with additional precautions)
- Custom command lists can be specified as arguments

### Project Creation
Create new projects safely with the built-in project creation tool:
- Supported project types: React, Node.js, Python
- Projects created in a sandboxed `~/AIProjects` directory

### Available Tools
1. **execute_command**: Run Windows CLI commands
2. **execute_powershell**: Execute PowerShell scripts
3. **create_project**: Safely create new development projects
4. **list_running_processes**: Retrieve active system processes
5. **get_system_info**: Collect system configuration details
6. **get_network_info**: Retrieve network adapter information
7. **get_scheduled_tasks**: List and query system tasks
8. **get_service_info**: Manage and query Windows services

## Security Considerations

### Allowed Commands
By default, only safe commands are permitted:
- System information retrieval
- Network configuration
- Process management
- Development tool interactions

### Blocked Operations
Dangerous commands are always blocked, including:
- Disk formatting
- User management
- System shutdown
- Critical registry modifications

## Configuration

Customize the server's behavior by specifying allowed commands or using configuration flags.

### Example
```bash
# Run with default safe commands
node dist/index.js

# Run with specific allowed commands
node dist/index.js dir echo npm git

# Run in extended mode (use with caution)
node dist/index.js --allow-all
```
